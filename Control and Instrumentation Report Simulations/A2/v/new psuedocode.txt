/*
* NOTE: the modification of the pseudocode is now simplified. The user only needs the average of three values at a time
* it was thought initially that the temp value needed to be in an array but that just makes the code more complex
* the new code outputs the average of 3 temp values each iteration of the while loop, the output is then displayed in a graph.
